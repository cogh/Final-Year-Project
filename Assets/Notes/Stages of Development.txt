Stages of Development
---------------------

Generation system:
- Create land plots on a grid
- Specify which plots as building/road
- Specify connections between road plots

Building plot system:
- Randomise archetype and building prefab
- Support multiple buildings with random count/placement and collision prevention

Building system:
- Randomise modular pieces of building

Road plot system:
- Specify archetype via connections
- Specify rotation via connections
- Generate waypoint nodes
- Create connections between waypoint nodes
- Create two-lane waypoint+connection system

Car system:
- Single AI car driving around one-lane system
- Single AI car driving around two-lane system
- Multiple cars driving around
- Multiple car prefabs
- Inter-lane collision prevention
- Intersection traffic lights AI
- Intersection turning
- Physics based locomotion rather than on-rails
- Physical collisions between cars
